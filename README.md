# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of analysis
     The purpose of the analysis was to take reviews of Amazon products in a category and put them into
a dataframe in google Colab to analyze the data further. We have also created four tables in pgAdmin to
export the new dataframes that were created. We have further analyzed the vine_table looking at the count
of total reviews and understanding how many of those reviews were from vine and non-vine reviewers.

## Results
     There are a total of 585 vine reviews and 61139 non-vine reviews giving the total number of reviews
a count of 61724. There were 213 paid five star reviews, and 28839 unpaid five star reviews. This gave
36.4% of the paid reviews being 5 stars and 47.2% of the unpaid reviews being 5 stars.

## Summary
    After observing the values in the data, it could be argued that there is no posivitivty bias in the
Vine program. The percentage of the paid five star reviews were actually less than the unpaid five star
reviews. Since the unpaid reviews also make up for a large majority of the total number of reviews, it
would be likely that there is no bias in the reviews that have been made.
